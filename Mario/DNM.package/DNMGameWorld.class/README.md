A DMNGameWorld is a central class of our game. After being initialized by a GameMenu it is responsible for creating level, ui, keyCodes... Therefore ist has several initializeX methods.
The gameElements are submorphs of the gameWorld. It itself is a TransformMorph and will scroll with mario.
During a game the gameWorld steps and calls #updateMovingObjects on its physics. 
It forwards keyboard input to its KeyboardListener.
